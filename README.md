- 👋 Hi, I’m @blackKeys17.
- 🏫 I'll hopefully be studying Maths at Cambridge this October.
- 👀 I’m interested in Maths, and I'm currently working on preparation for STEP 2 and 3. I'm working through Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler and Analysis 1 by Terence Tao.
- 🧠 I enjoy working with PyTorch, but I'm currently trying to gain a proper understanding of how neural networks are constructed by trying to build one myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying CS, Maths and Physics as a-levels.
- 🏆 I enjoy participating in Maths and Informatics Olympiads (even though I suck at them)
- 🥇 My (terrible) Codeforces profile: [darkFlower17](https://codeforces.com/profile/darkFlower17)
- 🤓 I like writing unreadable Python 1 line list comprehensions.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like playing piano.
