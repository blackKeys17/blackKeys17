- 👋 Hi, I’m @blackKeys17.
- 🏫 I'll hopefully be studying Maths at Cambridge University this October.
- 👀 I’m interested in Maths, and I'm currently working on preparation for STEP 2 and 3. I'm also working through Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler and Analysis 1 by Terence Tao, and planning to look through some of GTAC by Yufei Zhao and Algebra by Artin.
- 🧠 I have experience using PyTorch, but I'm currently trying to gain a comprehensive understanding of how neural networks are constructed by trying to build one myself. I'm currently learning about and implementing forwards and backwards autodiff for vector-valued functions.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying CS, Maths and Physics for a-levels.
- 🏆 I enjoy participating in Maths and Informatics Olympiads (even though I suck at them)
- 🥇 My (terrible) Codeforces profile: [darkFlower17](https://codeforces.com/profile/darkFlower17)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like playing piano (even though I suck at it).
